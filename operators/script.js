//!  Arithmetic Operators
// Addition operator (+) adds two numbers together
const applesOnHand = 5;
const applesReceived = 10;
const totalApples = applesOnHand + applesReceived;
 
// Subtraction operator (-) subtracts two numbers together
const totalTickets = 100;
const ticketSold = 45;
const ticketLeft = totalTickets - ticketSold;

// multiplication operator (*) multiplies two numbers together
const bookCosts = 20;
const bookBought = 15;
const totalBookPrice = bookCosts * bookBought;

// Division operator (/) divides two numbers together
const totalPages = 200;
const pagesRead = 40;
const daysToFinish = totalPages / pagesRead;

// Remainder or modulo operator (%) divides one number by 
// another and returns the remainder
const totalPeople = 10;
const totalPizza = 3;
const singleSlice = 1;
const peoplePerSlice = totalPeople % totalPizza;

// Increment operator (++) increases a number by 1
let currentWebsiteViews = 1000;
currentWebsiteViews++
// Its the same as currentWebsiteViews +=1;
// You could increase the currentWebsiteViews +=10;
// And the result is 1010;

// Decrement operator (--) decreases a number by 1
let currentSalesSold = 1000;
currentSalesSold--;
// Its the same as currentSalesSold -=1;
// You could decrease the currentSalesSold -=10;
// And the result is 990;
