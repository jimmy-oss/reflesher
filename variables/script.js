var myAge = 20;
let myMoney = 100;
const myCity = 'Nairobi';
 
//! Primitive Data Types

let fullName = "John Doe";
 
// Number

// What does null and undefined means in javascript 
// Both null and undefined represents absence of values
// But they are used in different circumstances
// For example undefined is value that has been declared
// that has no assigned value and by default it will give
// you undefined
// null is an assignment value that has been assigned to a variable
// that represents no value or no object and it implies an empty
// or a non-existing value so in short they are both empty when a variable
// is declared but they have some differences is some situations.
