  <h1>Javascript Variables</h1>
<!-- JavaScript variables are containers for storing data values.--->
<!-- Javascript Syntax There are three ways to declare variables  -->
 <!-- 1. var is function-scoped or globally-scoped
      2. let is a block-scoped variable
      3. const is a block-scoped and immutable variable-->
<!-- Data Types
 1. Primitive - They are immutable this means it cannot be changed once they are set
    and hold only one value at a time.  
 2. Non Primitive - They are reference types or objects,they are more complex
   and can store multiple values as a single entity -->
